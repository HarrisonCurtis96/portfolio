# portfolio

Hello, welcome to my portfolio, here you will find some pieces of code that I have written.

All the files in this repoistory were written as part of my final year project, this made up most of my degree in my final year at Loughborough University.
The project was a virtual reality application which allowed people to improve their public speaking skills and was graded as a 2:1.
For any employers or other individuals who would like further information about myself or my work feel free to contact me via my email provided below.
